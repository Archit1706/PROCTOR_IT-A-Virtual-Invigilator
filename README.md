# PROCTOR_IT-A-Virtual-Invigilator

An Application that detects face before start of the exam and keeps track of eye movement during the exam

  Schools and universities may have been closed, but they have transitioned to tools like Meet and Teams to complete their academic years. However, no solution to examinations has been developed. Some have altered it to an assignment form that students can easily copy and paste from the internet, whereas others have simply canceled them. We need some solution if the way we live is to become the new norm. So in order to find the solution for such a problem we create an application that can monitor students throughout the examination.
